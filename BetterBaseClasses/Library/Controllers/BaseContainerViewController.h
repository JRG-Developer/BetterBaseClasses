/**
 *  @brief  `BaseContainerViewController` is an abstract, base class meant to be subclassed instead of `UIViewController`. This makes it easier to create container view controllers with a "top" and "bottom" content views or view controllers.
 *
 *  @discussion  This class is meant to be used with the `UIViewController+BetterBaseClasses` category, which provides convenience instantiation methods.
 *
 *  This class calls `commonInit` in each of the initializers provided by its super class. Additionally, it overrides certain view methods (`preferredInterfaceOrientationForPresentation`, `preferredStatusBarStyle`, `shouldAutorotate`, and `supportedInterfaceOrientations`) to forward these onto its child view controller.
