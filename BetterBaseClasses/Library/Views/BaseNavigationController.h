/**
 *  @brief  `BaseNavigationController` is an abstract, base class meant to be subclassed instead of `UINavigationController`.
 *
 *  @discussion  This class is meant to be used with the `UIViewController+BetterBaseClasses` category, which provides convenience instantiation methods.
 *
 *  This class calls `commonInit` in each of the initializers provided by its super class. Additionally, it overrides certain view methods (`preferredInterfaceOrientationForPresentation`, `preferredStatusBarStyle`, `shouldAutorotate`, and `supportedInterfaceOrientations`) to forward these onto the currently showing view controller, which realistically is what you most likely expected it to do anyways... ;]
