/**
 *  @brief  `BaseViewController` is an abstract, base class meant to be subclassed instead of `UIViewController`.
 *
 *  @discussion  Most view controllers will only have *ONE* nib or storyboard scene associated with them. This class, combined with the `UIViewController+BetterBaseClasses` category, lets you specify the `identifier`, `bundle`, and `storyboardName` as part of the class- where it makes more sense for it to be in most cases- and perform common setup code in `commonInit`.
 
    This also makes creating and consuming a CocoaPod *much* easier.
 
    In example, instead of having to call `initWithNibName: bundle:`, which requires that the consuming app have knowledge of the nib name and the bundle, you can simply call `instanceFromNib`.

 *
 *  @note If your subclass adds a new designated initializer, you should call this method within it.
