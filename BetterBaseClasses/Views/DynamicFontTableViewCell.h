/**
 *  @brief  `DynamicFontTableViewCell` is a subclass of `BaseTableViewCell` that provides support for dynamic font types.
 *
 *  @discussion  This is an abstract, base class meant to be subclassed instead of `UITableViewCell`. In addition to the benefits gained by using `BaseTableViewCell` (see said class header for more details), this class provides support for dynamic font types via its `refreshView` method. You should override this method in your custom subclass in order to reset fonts, etc based on the user's preferred font size.
